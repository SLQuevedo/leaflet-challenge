# leaflet-challenge

## Opening Project
Opening the project through github pages will not show anything because I have my mapbox API key private. You must provide your own mapbox API key. Download all project files into your computer and in the leaflet-challenge folder create a javascript file named "config". Your config file should look like this:

Now you will be able to view the website by clicking on the "index.html" file. I will provide screenshots of the website in this document. 

## Using the Website
Upon load, the website will have the gray scale view of the map. Here is a screenshot of how it should look.

On the top right corner you can select how the base map will look between satellite, outdoors and dark styles. Below are some screen shots of what each style looks like.

You can also zoom in and back out to get a closer look at where the earthquake occurred. You can also click the the earthquake markers to see the time, location, and magnitude of each earthquake. The key for each marker corresponds to the depth (in meters) where it occurred, the legend can be found in the bottom left of the website.

The last feature is toggling the earthquake and tectonic plate markers in the upper right box.
